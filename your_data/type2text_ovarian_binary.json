These cells have regular gene expression patterns, maintain tissue homeostasis, and do not show signs of malignancy or uncontrolled growth. They perform their normal physiological functions and maintain proper cell cycle regulation.",
  "Malignant": "Malignant cell: A cancerous cell that has undergone genetic mutations leading to uncontrolled growth and proliferation. These cells show abnormal gene expression patterns, can invade surrounding tissues, have the potential to metastasize to other parts of the body, and exhibit characteristics of cancer including dysregulated cell cycle, altered metabolism, and resistance to cell death."
